Step 1: Data imputation/editing
- imputed dataset using missForest package. see practice.R in the missForest folder.
- selected first imputed dataset for each reading comprehension measure
- cbinded KTEA, ND, and GM columns to the WJ3 imputed dataset

--- Steps 2 - 5 are all done in the Classifer.R file -- 

Step 2: Classifier
- run the classifier for all RC measures for the following CIs:
-- 10/70
-- 15/65
-- 15/60
-- 15/70
-- 20/65
-- 20/70

* all measures were transformed, due to conversation with D. Braze

Step 3: Merge with MRI lists, check group sizes

Step 4: Check group differences

-- results from steps 3 and 4 are in the summary.xlsx file -- 

Step 5: Select model




possible things to worry about:
-- autocorrelations
-- distribution of residuals
-- check and maybe transform reading comprehension measure
